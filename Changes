v0.2
- added URL class for working with opensearch v1.1
- modified Client to select the best template target with a new method in 
  Description called select_best_template, it prefers atom to rss, and rss
  to vanilla xml, or the first template available
- added tests of v1.1 targets in test/version1_1.py
- added Changes file
- added latest feedparser for atom1.0 support
- modified Query to recognize optional search parameters {startIndex?}
- added support for empty totalResults, startIndex, itemsPerPage coming back 
  in responses
- for some reason sometimes opensearch namespaced elements are turning up 
  in feedparser with the opensearch_ prefix and other times without it. 
  this should be investigated but for the moment, Results will look for 
  data points in both places
- renamed feedparser.py to osfeedparser.py, and parse() to opensearch_parser()
  to avoid import confusion
